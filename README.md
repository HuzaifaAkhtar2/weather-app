# Weather App
## Goal 

In this project I was required to build a weather app that displays the current weather details based on the location entered by the user. 

## Requirements:

- [x] The User should be able to enter a location into an input field
- [x] The User will be presented with temperature, wind speed, likelihood of rain, and general weather i.e. Sunny, Raining, Cloudy etc.
- [x] The User will be shown the previous and future 24 hour periods.
- [x] The weather outlook can be refreshed by the user.
